# Simple Deep Learning Project with Keras

A simple keras model that predicts whether a person has diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database‚Äù dataset.
Link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

##### Story of the Dataset
1. Pregnancies: number of pregnancies
2. Glucose: glucose-value
3. BloodPressure: blood pressure value (mmHg)
4. SkinThickness: Skin Thickness value (mm)
5. Insulin: Insulin value
6. BMI: Body Mass Index
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates our probability of having diabetes based on information in our ancestry
8. Age
9. Outcome: Diabetic or not Diabetic (1 or 0)


Real information of different people is represented in each row of our dataset. The first 8 columns contain the information of the people. In the 9th column, there are 0-1 values that define whether the person has diabetes or not.

The purpose of this code is not to create a perfect prediction model, but to learn keras with the project.
